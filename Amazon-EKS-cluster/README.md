# Amazon EKS Cluster Deployment with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform configuration files to deploy an Amazon EKS cluster in the AWS ap-southeast-1 region.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI configured with the necessary credentials.

## Terraform Configuration

1. Clone this repository:

```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd terraform-eks-cluster
```

2. Initialize and Apply the Terraform Configuration
Initialize the Terraform configuration and apply it to create the EKS cluster. Run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt for confirmation before making any changes. Enter yes to proceed with the deployment.

This step provisions the necessary AWS resources, including the EKS cluster and worker nodes.

3. Access the EKS Cluster
After the Terraform apply completes, you can access the EKS cluster by exporting the generated kubeconfig file. Run the following command:

```
export KUBECONFIG=$(terraform output kubeconfig)
```
This sets the KUBECONFIG environment variable to point to the kubeconfig file generated by Terraform. Now you can use standard kubectl commands to interact with your EKS cluster.

Steps to create CI/CD Pieline in Gitlab


# Flask Redis Counter

This is a simple Flask application that displays a message on the webpage, indicating the visitor count fetched from Redis. The counter increments with each visit to the index page.

## Automated Deployment with GitLab CI/CD

This project utilizes GitLab CI/CD for automated building, testing, and deployment to production. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set up and configure the CI/CD pipeline.

### 1. GitLab Repository Setup

- Create a new GitLab repository for your project.
- Push your existing code to this repository.

### 2. Define GitLab CI/CD Configuration

Create a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  IMAGE_NAME: registry.gitlab.com/<your_username>/<your_project_name>

before_script:
  - echo "Before script steps go here"

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Run tests here"

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - master
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production"
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_JOB_TOKEN $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker push $IMAGE_NAME
```

3. Configure Docker Registry:
GitLab CI/CD uses the GitLab Container Registry to store Docker images. Ensure that the Container Registry is enabled in your project settings.

4. Environment Variables:
Set environment variables in GitLab CI/CD settings for sensitive information like secret keys or API tokens.

5. Integration Testing:
If needed, add integration tests to the test stage to ensure the application behaves correctly.

6. Update Dockerfile:
Consider updating the Dockerfile to use environment variables for configurable values, making it more flexible for different environments.

7. Production Configuration:
Create separate configuration files for production, e.g., config.prod.py, and ensure the necessary production configurations are set.

8. Continuous Deployment:
If you want continuous deployment, trigger the pipeline automatically on every push to the master branch. Adjust the only conditions in the deploy stage accordingly.

9. Review and Optimize:
Regularly review and optimize your GitLab CI/CD configuration for performance and security.

10. Monitoring and Logging:
Implement monitoring and logging in your production environment to track the application's performance and identify any issues.

11. Rollback Plan:
Implement a rollback plan in case of deployment failures. This may involve tagging releases and having the ability to roll back to a previous version.

12. Documentation:
Keep the GitLab CI/CD configuration and deployment process well-documented for future reference.

13. Security Scanning (Optional):
Integrate security scanning tools into your pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies or the Docker image.

14. Finalize Pipeline:
Once everything is set up, test the complete pipeline and ensure it successfully deploys the application to production.
